# blazor-portfolio

Learning the ins and outs of Blazor WebASM and WebAPI to make a Progressive Web Application.

Mostly following along a udemy course with some minor changes along the way. Eventually this will be more customised.

There are lots of atomic commits in this repo to allow reviewing and backtracking.
